rails-load-stats.py and candlepin-load-stats.py scripts for creating statistics. Both scripts work quite similarly.

## rails-load-stats.py

rails-load-stats.py is [rails-load-stats script](https://github.com/pmoravec/rails-load-stats) writen in Python. Similarly as [rails-load-stats script](https://github.com/pmoravec/rails-load-stats) it processes a logfile of a Ruby on Rails app to analyze where the load to the app comes from.  Similarly as [rails-load-stats script](https://github.com/pmoravec/rails-load-stats) it produces statistics about:
- Particular requests: how many requests against each method were raised, how much (min/max/avg/sum) time these took, and what percentage of overall execution time was spent by processing the different types of requests.
- Maximal level of concurrency: the peak number of requests that were processed in parallel.

rails-load-stats-py is faster than the original bash version (especially for larger logfiles) and it contains some new features:
- list of particular requests from the most busy time (processed with the most concurrency)
- if "--with_stats" option is used, it creates directory "`stats` + name of the input file" and for each request type it creates two files in the directory:
    - plot with the times of all requests of the type (sorted by the timestamp of the request)
    - text file containing the time of the request and its unique id (sorted by the size of time spent on the request)
    

## Usage: 
    rails-load-stats <FILE> [SORTING_TYPE] [--with_stats]
    candlepin-load-stats <FILE> [SORTING_TYPE] [--with_stats]

        Possible sorting types are:
            1 or 'name': sort by the request_type
            2 or 'count': sort by the count
            3 or 'min': sort by the min time
            4 or 'max': sort by the max time
            5 or 'avg': sort by the avg time
            6 or 'mean': sort by the mean time
            7 or 8 or 'percentage': sort by the sum time / percentage

Now we can see the list of identificators + times spent on the request for any type of request. Request `PuppetcaController#index` (1st line in the previous table) is in `data_1.txt`, `HostsController#index` (2nd line) is in `data_2.txt`, ...

Corresponding `.png` file for `PuppetcaController#index` is in `plot_2.png`. In the file times spent on the request is depicted according to time order of the requests.

## Requirements:
Python version >= 3.6

tabulate - library for printing tables

mathplotlib - library for creating plots (if --without_stats is not used)


## candlepin-load-stats.py

candlepin-load-stats.py is similar as rails-load-stats.py script. It processes a candlepin logfile to analyze where the load to the app comes from. It works the same as rails-load-stats.py, and have the same usage and requirements.

Example output:

    there were 149084 requests taking 2137814 ms (i.e. 0.59 hours, i.e. 0.02 days) in summary

    action: request_type                                         count    min    max  -  max_id     avg    mean    sum    percentage
